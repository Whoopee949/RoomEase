# RoomEase Project Roadmap

## Project Summary
RoomEase is a web-based roommate selection system designed for students staying in hostels. The system enables students to choose their roommates based on compatibility. Compatibility is measured using preferences and traits such as sleep schedules, cleanliness habits, and personality traits. RoomEase uses a Google Sheets database to store student information and is built using Flask for the backend and potentially Next.js for the frontend.

## Features
1. **Student Login**: Secure login using institutional credentials.
2. **Compatibility Assessment**: Students are matched with others based on weighted criteria.
3. **Profile Browsing**: Students can view profiles of recommended roommates.
4. **Roommate Requests**: Students can request to pair with recommended roommates.
5. **Roommate Finalization**: Pairings are finalized when both students agree.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React-based)
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Database**: Google Sheets (via API integration)
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 or similar secure login mechanism
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
